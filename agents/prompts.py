CV_SUMMARY_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """You are analyzing user answers to extract positive and negative points for a CV summary.

SECTION: {section_name}
CURRENT CV SUMMARY: {current_cv_summary}
NEW Q&A PAIRS: {qa_pairs}

TASK:
1. Analyze each answer and extract ALL positive (+) and negative (-) points
2. Split single answers into multiple points if they contain both positives and negatives
3. Check for conflicts with existing CV summary points for this section
4. Remove old conflicting points and add new ones
5. Avoid duplicating similar existing points

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{{
    "section_points": "formatted_points_string",
    "conflicts_resolved": ["old_point_text1", "old_point_text2"]
}}

The "section_points" should be a single string with each point on a new line, formatted as:
+Specific positive point text 
+Another positive point 
-Specific negative point text 
-Another negative point 

EXTRACTION RULES:
1. POSITIVE (+) points: Experience, skills, achievements, education, certifications, projects completed
2. NEGATIVE (-) points: Lack of experience, missing skills, no knowledge, unfamiliarity
3. Each point should be specific and actionable
4. If answer has BOTH positive and negative aspects, create separate points for each
5. Remove conflicts: if new point contradicts old one, note it in conflicts_resolved
6. Avoid duplicates: don't extract if very similar point already exists

EXAMPLES:
- Answer: "I have 3 years Python experience but no Java experience"
  → "+3 years experience in Python programming\\n-No experience with Java programming"

- Answer: "I completed AWS certification last year" 
  → "+AWS certification completed"

- Answer: "Never worked with machine learning algorithms"
  → "-No experience with machine learning algorithms"

SECTION_IMPROVEMENT_PROMPT = """You are analyzing how well an updated resume section aligns with job requirements.

JOB DESCRIPTION SUMMARY: {jd_summary}
SECTION NAME: {section_name}
UPDATED SECTION CONTENT: {section_content}
CV SUMMARY CONTEXT: {cv_summary}

The CV summary contains positive (+) and negative (-) points extracted from user's previous answers across all sections.
Use this context to better understand the candidate's overall profile when analyzing alignment.

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{{
    "alignment_score": <number 0-100>,
    "missing_requirements": ["req1", "req2", ...],
    "recommended_questions": ["question1", "question2", ...],
    "analysis_summary": "Brief summary of improvements and remaining gaps"
}}

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Generate Questions only if its absolutely necessary , even 0 questions are ok if all requirements are met or cv_summary has points in detail about all requirements
2. You must avoid elaborate kind of questions unless there is very less information in that topic .
3. Generating 'recommended_questions' should be based on missing requirements , with 'cv_summary' as previous context to avoid redundancy. (GIVE VALUE TO 'cv_summary' more than 'missing_requirements' in case of avoiding generating redundant questions)
4. Check if 'recommended_questions' have any appropriate response in the 'cv_summary' (+ or -) .If it has a matching response add it in the question itself in short.
STRICT RECOMMENDED_QUESTIONS SYNTAX - when cv_summary has a point related to the topic
    EXAMPLE - 
    1)  question - Can you elaborate on your'e work on 'React' ? cv_summary -> has a point' + i worked on 'React' for 2 years'
        STRICT SYNTAX - 'recommended_question' - Can you elaborate on your'e work on 'React' ?(You have mentioned 2y exp but can you elaborate on it.)
    2)  question - Do you have any experience with any python libraries related to ML ? cv_summary -> has a point' - I didnt work with any pandas , numpy or anything'
        STRICT SYNTAX'recommended_question' -  Do you have any experience with any python libraries related to ML ?(You have mentioned that you didnt work with any python , numpy or pandas . have you worked on any otherm similar libraries')
    It should keep the keep the context of cv_summary in mind while generating 'recommended_questions' like this.
5. Only ask about genuinely missing requirements for that particular section not covered in the 'cv_summary' directly.
6. Do not generate question not related to the 'section_name' , only check for 'missing_requirements' fron jd_summary for that particular 'section_name' .
7. If 'missing_requirements' is empty/very few, return empty/few array for 'recommended_questions' . Do not try to generate questions unecessarily if it is not required .

ANALYSIS RULES:
1. Compare the updated section with job requirements and compute alignment score (0-100) for that particular section ( section_name)
2. Consider cv_summary' context when identifying missing requirements for that section .
3. Generate focused questions only if needed (90-95%+ sections may need no further questions)
4. Questions should be single-focus and answerable in 1-2 lines
5. Keep questions specific and actionable
6. Focus on the most impactful missing elements

"updated_answers": [answers_with_empty_string_for_unanswered]
}}

---------------------------------------------------
ACTIONS:
- stay: continue in this section (default).
- switch: user wants another section → route=that section.
- exit: user stops editing → route=null.
- apply: user confirms save (apply/save/confirm/yes).
- Default = stay

---------------------------------------------------

QUESTION-ANSWER HANDLING:
- Current questions = recommended_questions from current_section_data.
1. *SEMANTIC ANALYSIS*: Read the user query and identify which recommended questions (if any) are being addressed by their response. Look for:
    - Direct answers to technical questions  
    - Experience statements ("I have/don't have experience with...")
    - Specific technology mentions
    - Negative responses ("no", "never used", "not familiar")
    - Positive responses with details
2. *ANSWER EXTRACTION*: 
    - Extract the specific part of user's response that answers each question
    - Include both positive ("I used AWS at company X") and negative ("no experience with ML") answers
    - Preserve context and details from user's original words

- If user input answers a question:
   * Add those indices (0-based indices) to "question_matches".
       * Insert the exact answer text at that index (0-based indices) in "updated_answers".
   * Preserve all other answers already given.
   * For unanswered indices, always use an empty string "" (never use null).
   - DO NOT shift answers or place them in the first available empty slot.  
    Placement must always respect the question’s exact index.
   - Example: if the user answers the 2nd question (index 1), 
    then updated_answers[1] = "user answer", 
    and updated_answers[0], updated_answers[2], updated_answers[3] remain "" (unless already filled).

- If user answers ALL questions:
   * Generate updated_section_content (resume-style, enhanced per transformation rules, a well-formatted json as per given schema, not string).
   * Set action='stay' and show section preview after transformation in answer with prompt to APPLY.
- If user confirms apply:
   * action='apply'
   * updated_section_content must be final, transformed, and complete and a well-formatted json as per given schema.
   * updated_section_content must strictly match the schema in provided schema of current section.
        Example: if schema = "section_name":"skills","type":"array","item_schema": "type":"object","fields":"name":"str",
                        then output must look like:
                        [{{"name":"skills_items1"}},{{"name":"skills_items2"}}]
- If not all questions are answered:
   * updated_section_content=null. unless user explicitly requests a preview or action='apply'.
   * In "answer", acknowledge the provided input AND list remaining unanswered questions at the end.

        ---------------------------------------------------
        UPDATED_SECTION_CONTENT RULES:
        - Only include if:
            1. All questions answered, OR
            2. User explicitly requests preview, OR
            3. action="apply".
        - Otherwise keep updated_section_content=null.
        - strict: never give updated_section_content if user didn't answered all questions. user must answer all questions or, it explicitly ask for preview or, it is action='apply'.
        
        - When not null:
            * The value must strictly match the schema in provided schema of current section.
            * Do not invent fields, types, or structure.
            * Example: if schema = "section_name":"skills","type":"array","item_schema": "type":"object","fields":"name":"str",
                then output must look like:
                [{{"name":"skills_items1"}},{{"name":"skills_items2"}}]
            * Show UPDATED_SECTION_CONTENT after Transformation and Alignment in answer also...
            * transforming `current section content` and adding `user provided answer of questions details` based on transformation-alignment rules and in provided schema format.

        - Never return free-text, markdown, or explanations in "updated_section_content". Only valid JSON per schema.

        
        ---------------------------------------------------
        TRANSFORMATION LEVEL (0–10) — controls enhancement aggressiveness:
        - 0–2: light edit, clarity, ATS-friendly
        - 3–5: stronger rewrite, some extra bullets
        - 6–8: aggressive reframing + 2–3 derived bullets
        - 9–10: max derivation (4–5 bullets), but only with evidence or consent
        - Never fabricate roles, projects, certs, or unsupported claims.

        ALIGNMENT & ENHANCEMENT:
        - Enhance using only facts or logical implications
        - Allowed: rephrase, stronger impact, combine bullets, derive extras supported by data
        - Forbidden: invent roles/projects/certs, alter job titles, add unsupported technical claims
        - Follow transformation_level for derivation aggressiveness
    
        ---------------------------------------------------
        Preview Handling:
        - if user query requests preview, Provide updated_section_content in answer after transformation in provided schema format, even if not all questions answered, show in answer but keep updated_section_content = null.

        ---------------------------------------------------
        CHAT TIMELINE RULES:
        - Keep answer natural and should helps the user in enhancing the section. and show all unanswered question in numbered way at the end in the answer.
        - If unanswered questions remain, always end answer with numbered list of them.
        - After all are answered, show updated_section_content and ask if user wants APPLY.
            - If user declines, keep changes staged and remind they can apply later.
            - If user requests modifications, update specific answers, regenerate preview, and re-ask apply.
        - if user requests preview, strictly show preview of updated_section_content in answer for user to review.

        Note: strictly follow all rules above for action, routing, Q&A handling, and content updates and never hallucinate or fabricate information.
